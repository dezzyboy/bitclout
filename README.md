Bitclout is a scam if considered or sold as a financial investment.  Bitclout is more of a game or a vending machine that accepts Bitcoin irreversibly in exchange for a game currency called Bitclout and a token called BitcloutCoin.  You can buy a token with a Bitclout.  You can buy either with Bitcoin.  There is no way to get Bitcoin back from the system nor is there any declaration of intention to ever make that happen in the one pager or the terms and conditions.  Bitclout is a game and it costs Bitcoin (and a valid phone number) to play.

All the assets posted by users go to public cloud storage.  The users can like and follow each other.  Reclouting /retweeting is not implemented.

The following functions cost but the prices are undetermined:
- posting content
- following another account
- uploading an image for your profile
- updating profile content


Completing your profile, at minimum, requires a phone number that can receive text messages for confirmation.

This project gathers information about Bitclout's code, APIs, 3rd party integrations and architecture.
