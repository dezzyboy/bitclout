Bitclout is a scam if considered or sold as a financial investment.  Bitclout is more of a game or a vending machine that accepts Bitcoin irreversibly in exchange for a game currency called Bitclout and a token called BitcloutCoin.  You can buy a token with Bitclout.  You can buy either with Bitcoin.  There is no way to get Bitcoin back from the system nor is there any declaration of intention to ever make that happen in the one pager or the terms and conditions.  Bitclout is a game and it costs Bitcoin (and a valid phone number) to play.

All the assets posted by users go to public cloud storage.  Registered users can like and follow each other.  

Update 4/9/2021: Reclouting /retweeting functionality appeared overnight after some new code was deployed.

The following functions cost *Bitcoin* to get started. The prices are set by the current cost of *Bitcoin* transaction fees:
- posting content
- following an account
- creating and saving or changing a profile image
- creating and saving or updating profile content

All actions are really based on blockcypher.com and other public vendors and APIs, which makes setting up the technology for Bitclout a low bar.  All of the strongest technical aspects of Bitclout are based on Cloudflare, Angular, blockcypher.com, Node js, Nginx, Google Fonts.  By the same token, the mastery in orchestrating the Bitclout solution is respectable.

Completing your profile, at minimum, requires a phone number that can receive text messages for confirmation.

This project gathers information about Bitclout's code, APIs, 3rd party integrations and architecture.
